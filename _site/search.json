According to Guide to GIS and Image Processing,1 “the user develops the spectral signatures of known categories, such as urban and forest, and then the software assigns each pixel in the image to the cover type to which its signature is most comparable”. We felt that supervised classification would be able to help us perform an controlled quantitative analyses of remote sensing image data.\n\nTraining Sites\nHere are our 9 classes that we have defined.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first define the areas that will be used as training sites, using SCP, it will then create ROIs (Regions of Interest) and spectral signatures required for the classification of a band set.\n\n\n\nSpectural Signature Plot\nSpectural Signature includes several functions for displaying spectral signature values as a function of wavelength(defined in the band set). If common classifications are too near that they overlap, it will be hard differentiate the different classes(e.g managed vegetation, natural vegetation)\n\n\n\nSupervised Classification\nThrough various tests, we compared both the maximum likelihood and minimum distance and decided to use maximum likelihood as it yields more accuracy as compared to minimum distance.\nBased on the algorithm, each of the pixels will be assigned to the class that has the highest probability, which is the maximum likelihood.\n\n\nAccuracy Assessment\nWith the test samples classified, we will then created another set of train samples, to test the accuracy of the classification. More details can be viewed under Analysis."

A sample extract of our notes would look like:\n\n![](images/consult.png)\n\nThen every member sharing about the literature studies that they have conducted with regards to each sub-theme.\n\nAvigale: Shared about an article on Theme 2: Sub-theme 2 and the article was about the catchment area analysis of an urban railway station in Seoul. She explained how the analysis created help people to better understand the livability of residents within the area and how residents could potentially benefit from it.\nJia Ying: Shared about an article on Theme 2: Sub-theme 1 and the article was about why schools had to opt for mergers and what are the potential impacts. Relating back to what we have learnt in class, she quickly suggested that the merger and closure of schools may result in inequity of access for some students\nYuyang: Shared about an article on Theme 1 : Sub-theme 1 and felt that the topic would be relatively easier to do as the article had clear methodology on land classification studies.\n\nAfter intense discussion, we do agree with the fact that the opening of Thomson-line has limited data and literature studies that we can refer to and it might be more difficult to embark on that as compared the rest of the sub-themes.\nWe all agreed on focusing on Theme 1 : Sub-theme 1 and decided to save Theme 2: Sub-theme 1 as a back-up plan because we thought we had a better understanding of what to do with regards to the theme.\nThe team then took a bit of time to explore the relevant data and discuss on the area of study.\n\nAvigale felt that Philippines would be easier to do as there is large areas of forested land.\nYuyang thought Shanghai would be easier to do because there is a more rapid land usage change observed in the recent years.\nHowever, Jia Ying quickly pointed out we are doing land cover classification and not land use. Philippine is interesting to do but we might be unfamiliar with the area to judge the classes for classification.\n\ni continue later"
