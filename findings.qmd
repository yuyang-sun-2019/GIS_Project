## Overall

Results showed that the overall accuracy was 43.69% for Sentinel-2 while it was 51.24% for Landsat 8. Similarly the Kappa Hat classification was calculated 0.3348 and 0.4216 for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 respectively.

## Water Bodies

In the case of water bodies, Landsat 8 performed better than Sentinel-2 as it managed to identify water bodies and Inland water.

## Vegetation

Other than the misclassification of managed vegetation for bare land in Sentinel-2, we could see that Sentinel-2 effectively identified between Natural vegetation and Managed vegetation as compared to Landsat 8. Landsat 8 was rather sparse in the classification of vegetation, especially near the Seletar bus depot.

## Discussion/ Future works

Both satellite imagery has their own benefits, with Sentinel-2 being clearer due to its spatial resolution and higher accuracy in classification for vegetation. On the other hand, Landsat 8 though lacking in spatial resolution, it performed better in terms of water body classification. We hope that the results would be useful for future land cover classification and a recommendation from us would be to merge Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery together to improve the overall accuracy

## Literature Review

Our team has conducted several literatures reviews and found that out Sentinel-2A data has similar spectral bands and geometric accuracyÂ to Landsat 8. (EROS, 2019) Readings also suggest that when the red-edge bands in both datasets are being compared, a combination of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands resulted in a higher accuracy index than Landsat-8 alone. (Gerald Forkuor et al, 2018) Therefore, we wanted to use the comparison study as an opportunity to explore the data insights that both datasets could be used to uncover.
