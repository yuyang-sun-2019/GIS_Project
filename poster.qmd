## Literature Review

Our team has conducted several literatures reviews and found that out Sentinel-2A data has similar spectral bands and geometric accuracyÂ to Landsat 8. (EROS, 2019) Readings also suggest that when the red-edge bands in both datasets are being compared, a combination of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands resulted in a higher accuracy index than Landsat-8 alone. (Gerald Forkuor et al, 2018) Therefore, we wanted to use the comparison study as an opportunity to explore the data insights that both datasets could be used to uncover.
