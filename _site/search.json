She explained how the analysis created help people to better understand the livability of residents within the area and how residents nearby could potentially benefit from it.\nJia Yiing: Shared about an article on Theme 2: Sub-theme 1 and the article was about why schools had to opt for mergers and what are the potential impacts. Relating back to what we have learnt in class, she quickly suggested that the merger and closure of schools may result in inequity of access for some students\nYuyang: Shared about an article on Theme 1 : Sub-theme 1 and felt that the topic would be relatively easier to do as the article had clear methodology on land classification studies.\n\nAfter intense discussion, we do agree with the fact that the opening of Thomson-line has limited literature studies that we can refer to and hence it might be more difficult to embark on that as compared the rest of the sub-themes.\nWith that, we all agreed on focusing on Theme 1 : Sub-theme 1 and decided to save Theme 2: Sub-theme 1 as a back-up plan because we felt that we had a better understanding of what to do.\nThe team then took a bit of time to explore the relevant data and discuss on the area of study.\n\nAvigale felt that Philippines would be easier to do as there is large areas of forested land.\nYuyang thought Shanghai would be easier to do because there is a more rapid land usage change observed in the recent years.\nHowever, Jia Yiing quickly pointed out we are doing land cover classification and not land use. Philippines is interesting to do but we might be unfamiliar with the area to judge the classes for classification.\n\nWe then quickly come to a consensus that maybe we should explore Singapore instead since we are more familiar with the area.\n\nYuyang felt that she was more interested to do the west side of Singapore since she is staying nearer to the West.\nJia Yiing pointed that maybe we can explore the data images and look out for the possible areas to explore and we should avoid areas covered by clouds like West.\nAvigale suggested that we can look at the north part of Singapore since there are more potential classes to explore.\n\nWith that, we all agreed to focus on the North Part of Singapore in this project.
