## Motivation of Project

Land cover classification is an important remote sensing application. Satellite optical and radar images are two of the most widely used remote sensing images with respective advantages and disadvantages.

Using both radar and optical images and machine learning, this project is to explore automatic land cover classification traditionally done manually or semi-manually.

## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to study, develop and compare different ensemble/non-ensemble machine learning algorithms for the and learn the pre-processing procedure and general flow of any land-cover classification based on the remote sensing data. By analyzing different classification results with various machine learning algorithms, we can get a deep understanding of discriminating machine learning problems.

## Data

The study area is located at the north of Singapore. The north of Singapore holds a variety of landscape characteristics which is useful for classification.

1.  Landsat 8 (20180524) Imagery (Bands 1-7)

2.  Sentinel-2 (20200126) Imagery (Bands 2,3,4,8)

## Scope of Work

### Task 1: Data Collection

We first gather the satellite imagery data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 respectively. They are obtainable at \<\> \<\>

In order to perform the analysis accurately, we gather data that are within 5-10% cloud

### Task 2 : Study Area Selection

## Project Schedule

This is our overall Gantt Chart
